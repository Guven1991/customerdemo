# Customer Demo Project

This project I made for 32 bit is a demo project where we can register customers, fetch that customer by customer ID, fetch all customers so that they can be paginated, sorted and filtered, and we can delete the customer.

At the same time, these services that I wrote in the project are a project that includes error management, logging operations and Unit Tests of Services.

##The technologies and frameworks I have used in the project are as follows;

###Java
###Maven
###Spring Boot
###Spring Security
###JWT Web Token
###PostgreSQL
###Hibernate
###Slf4j
###Swagger 3
###DozerBeanMapper
###Junit
